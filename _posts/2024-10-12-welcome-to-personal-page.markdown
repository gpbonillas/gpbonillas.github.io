In my free time, I enjoy reading the Bible or books about theology, caring my native bees hives (Meliponiculture), and learning new programming languages.

My technical background is:
- Java

I am studying a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [UNIR](https://www.unir.net/). My thesis (TFM) proposal is about *"Clasificador de abejas nativas del Ecuador usando técnicas de clasificación y visión artificial"*. I will share my experiences and thoughts about my thesis and my journey through the Master's degree.
