Ecuadorian Software Engineer and Data Scientist.
I write about my experiences and thoughts on technology, machine learning, and software engineering.
I am a lifelong learner and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
In my free time, I enjoy reading, caring my native bees hives, and learning new things.
My identity is a Jesus follower. My verse is John 14:6.

I am studying a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [UNIR](https://www.unir.net/). My thesis (TFM) proposal is about *"Clasificador de abejas nativas del Ecuador usando técnicas de clasificación y visión artificial"*.
